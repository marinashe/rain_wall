# Description

This project solves the problem of calculation how much rain will be trapped in a wall with different heights.

You can visit a working demo here: https://marinashe.github.io/rain_wall/

The basic algorithm can be found here: https://github.com/marinashe/rain_wall/blob/master/src/calculate_volume_water.js

# Instructions

![](/demo.png)

* Drag the grass left-right to change the length of the wall
* Drag the bricks or the grass up-down to build a higher wall
* Click on the cloud to make it rain
* Click the cloud again to go back to edit mode
* The text field can be used to build custom walls. But if the wall is too long/high, no animation will be displayed
